Plug it in victims computer, run autorun, and then click on "file" to see all the files being copied. 
Make sure in the folder where you store all of these files, you make a folder called "all" dont put anything in it because this will be what all the stolen pictures/videos/documents go in.

  
    
This was coded with a few batch and vbs files back in 2020, back when all i knew was windows batch files lol
